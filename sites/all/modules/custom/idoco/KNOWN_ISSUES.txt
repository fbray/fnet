While Simple HTML DOM Parser is generally very effective, it does seem to
mis-handle some of our structure. For example, there are embedded <font> tags
all over these documents. I've attempted to get rid of all of them, but some of
the nested font tags are not being replaced. This is why there are still some
funky looking fonts in our content.

For example:

&lt;font color="green"&gt;
  this is green
  &lt;font color="red"&gt;this is red&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;/font&gt;

The green font tag will be stripped, but the red one will not.
