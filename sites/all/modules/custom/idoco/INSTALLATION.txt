- Enable idoco module

- Using the IMCE tool available at user/USER_ID/imce, create a directory in the
  site's files directory called something like 'idoco_help_files'

- In that new directory, upload a .zip file that contains the top level folders
  for the documentation (ie the .zip file should expand directly to the content
  folders. Be sure this folder contains the proper version of exported HTML! The
  contents should include a 'toc.html' and a 'help_main.html' file in every
  chapter directory. Uploading of the incorrect HTML will probably break the
  idoco presentation.

- Go to Idoco configuration (/admin/settings/idoco) and configure the 'Path to
  documentation' and 'Import file name' values. Leave the rest blank for now.
  Save the settings.

- Visit /idoco - this will cause the .zip file to be extracted.

- Go back to Idoco configuration and set the 'Default page file'. Also order the
  Sections appropriately.
